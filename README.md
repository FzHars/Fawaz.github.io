# Portfolio website (Recommended for Beginners)

## Overview

This is a personal portfolio website built to showcase my projects, skills, and experiences in web development.

## Technologies Used

This project leverages a variety of modern web technologies to create an optimized, responsive, and visually engaging user experience:

- **HTML5**: Used to structure the content in a clear, semantic, and accessible way.
- **CSS3**: Provides custom styling and ensures the layout is responsive across different devices.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Powers the interactivity and dynamic elements of the application, improving user engagement.
- **Bootstrap 5**: A flexible and responsive front-end framework that helps in designing a mobile-first, responsive layout with ease.
- **AOS (Animate On Scroll)**: Adds sleek animations to elements as they enter the viewport, enhancing visual appeal without sacrificing performance.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: Utilized for complex animations and smooth transitions, ensuring high performance even with multiple animated elements.

## Features
